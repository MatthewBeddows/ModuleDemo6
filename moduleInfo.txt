[System] Power Supply
The power supply unit (PSU) for the portable MRI scanner is designed to deliver high-performance power to the system while maintaining portability. Encased in a rugged yet lightweight aluminum alloy housing, the PSU is shockproof and waterproof, ensuring it can function in various environments. The unit is about the size of a small backpack, with a built-in handle for easy transport.
[Module] Surge Protection
This module is integrated into the power supply to prevent power spikes from damaging the sensitive components of the MRI scanner. It contains circuit breakers and capacitors that absorb excess voltage and safely discharge it.
